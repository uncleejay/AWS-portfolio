# AWS Portfolio - 7 Days DevOps Challenge

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This repo contains all the projects I built during a 7-day DevOps challenge focused on AWS services.  
The goal? To set up a full CI/CD pipeline, host a web app, lock down cloud security, and even visualize some data â€” all powered by AWS!

Below is a quick breakdown of each project:

## Project 01 - Host a Website on S3
- Set up a static website hosted entirely on AWS S3.
- Configured S3 bucket policies and static hosting settings.

## Project 02 - Data Visualization with QuickSight
- Collected and visualized data using Amazon QuickSight.
- Built interactive dashboards.
- Explored how QuickSight connects to S3 and other AWS data sources.

## Project 03 - Cloud Security with IAM
- Hands-on with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
- Created custom roles, policies, and groups to fine-tune cloud security.
- Best practices for least privilege access.

## Project 04 - Setup a Web App on EC2
- Launched and configured an EC2 instance.
- Deployed a sample web application (maven/java).
- Set up basic networking (Security Groups, Key Pairs).

## Project 05 - DevOps with AWS CodeArtifact
- Explored AWS CodeArtifact for package management.
- Published and retrieved packages using CodeArtifact in CI/CD pipelines.

## Project 06 - Connect AWS CodePipeline to GitHub
- Connected AWS CodePipeline to GitHub for continuous integration.
- Automated build and deployment triggers on every push.

## Project 07 - Build Apps with AWS CodeBuild
- Configured AWS CodeBuild projects for automated building and testing.
- Wrote custom buildspec.yml files to control build steps.

## Project 08 - Deploy Web App with AWS CodeDeploy
- Setup CloudFormation and Deployment groups
- Set up AWS CodeDeploy to deploy apps on EC2 instances.
- Handled blue/green deployments and rollbacks.

# Highlights of the Challenge
- Full CI/CD pipeline on AWS
- Cloud-native app hosting on EC2
- IAM-powered cloud security
- Data analytics and dashboards with QuickSight
- GitHub integration with AWS Developer Tools

# Why I Did This
I wanted to get hands-on experience with real-world DevOps tools and workflows using AWS.  
This 7-day sprint helped me understand the core building blocks for deploying, securing, and managing modern cloud applications.
